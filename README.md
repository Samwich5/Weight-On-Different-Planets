# Weight-On-Different-Planets
Mario has to do a lot of travelling since he is a well known Super Smash Bros. fighter. Since he is visiting the solar system he needs to know what his weight will be on each of the planets so he can prepare to battle his oppenents. I have created this program that will tell Mario his weight on all the planets in the Solar System. Note that Pluto is NOT included.
